            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

heart which is ſinne: And bee you comforted in this, that Chriſt Ieſus ſuffered for you: lay away Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, plucke vp your ſpirits, and put your ſelfe onely vpon God; liue not like a woman, but dye like a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Saint. Let not Impatience pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiſe your heart, neither let thought pierce your heart, but make patience and mirth the beſt phiſicke to your minde, and ſureſt comfort in your liues.</p>
               <p>Intreate the Lord to helpe you to beare your Croſſes, and ſo to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then you with his Spirit, that you become not hopeleſſe of recouery, and let no ſorrowes ſo afflict you, but as ſacred Comforts may ſoone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue you: Conſider your whole life to be nothing elſe but a continuall try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of your Conſcience in the ſpiritual Warfare.</p>
               <p>Remember that ſuch as depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any thing but on God alone, refuſe their owne felicity, and that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which they ſhould elſe receiue of God. Who knowes not this, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3626:9"/>
there is no Saluation but by Chriſt? There is no true reſt till I firſt feele Gods Iudgements, and the weight thereof which ſhall ſerue, through Chriſt, to my good.</p>
               <p>God doth now and then vſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre his helpe for a time, before hee will comfort his Church, People, or Children, yet when it is moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for them, his helpe is euer rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at hand. Conſider we all that the end of Gods chaſtiſements to his Children, is, to ſaue them from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and with-hold them from Hell.</p>
               <p>As God hath ſtrooken you, ſo hath hee power to reſtore you; as you are Gods ſeruant, you haue an Angell to defend you from your enemies, you are ſo deare vnto God, that he can no more ſuffer your enemies to hurt you, then a man can abide to be thruſt in the eyes.<note place="margin">Pſal. 17.8.</note>

               <p>For indeed wee which are in this Tabernacle, ſigh, and are burdened, becauſe wee would not bee vncloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, but would bee cloathed vppon that Mortality might bee ſwallowed vp of Life.

               <p>Terrours and deſtructions make men now and then to learne that which exhortations and gentleneſſe could not bring to paſſe: As the Plow-man hath his appointed time, and diuers Inſtruments for his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,

               <p>The deareſt of Gods Children may faint, but not finally faile and vtterly fall away. God will ſuffer his Church to bee afflicted, and yet at length ſend it deliuerance. God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth ſometimes his deareſt Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to want Conſolation, that his grace afterwards may the more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare when they feele their owne weakeneſſe. Doe wee not by our ſins prouoke God to take our liues from vs euery night? You are now afflicted in your bodies, yet aſſure your ſelues in the Lord, that you ſhall finde deliuerance at laſt, both for bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule, a very tranſlation into bliſſe: Gods power is ſufficient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of any other, our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father hath all meanes in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to bring his will to paſſe.</p>
               <p>

All power reſts in Gods hands to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer you when hee thinketh good.</p>
               <p>Therefore learne to abide Gods hand with patience, and not curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to ſeeke out the Cauſe of Gods delay in your Afflictions.

               <p>It is our fault that we are not ſoone reconciled one to another, and iudge

God by your ſelues: But hee is moſt eaſie to bee reconciled, offering dayly his mercies vnto vs, deliuerance is from Heauen, and God neuer forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his Children.</p>
               <p>There ſhall be great afflictions in the Church, but God will euer deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his.

               <p>Our Heauenly Father hath no need of mans helpe for the deliuerance of his, hee can eaſily deliuer his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and puniſh his foes. Conſider not ſo much what griefes and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you now beare in your Body, as what Chriſt hath borne for you to purchaſe your ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Remember why <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſo ſore afflicted, that they might in their troubles call to remembrance the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which God had beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in times paſt. Yeeld not to the Cenſure of thy fleſh, when God

doth not for Cauſes beſt knowne to himſelfe, ſend ſuccour vnto you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. You are in diſtreſſe and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, dedicate your ſelfe vnto Gods Seruice, and call vpon his Name: let all your Ioy bee in Gods Seruice and Worſhip, no mans helpe can ſaue you; put your confidence in GOD, looke for helpe at his hands, who hath better Phyſicke for your ſoules then any that commeth from <hi>Gilead.</hi> Pray with true Faith and Repentance, not for the ſmart and griefe which you feele to be remooued, but final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſanctified to your Honours ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Remember that God is the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and wee the Clay, hee hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ouer vs,<note place="margin">Eſay 45.9 Rom. 9.10</note> to doe with vs whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſeemeth good in his ſight. As no man that is a thirſt, refuſeth freſh Conduit-water which hee hath at home, to goe and ſeeke waters abroad to quench his thirſt: So wee ought not to ſeeke for helpe and ſuccour as Strangers, and leaue God which is preſent with vs. All which meane to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3626:14"/>
enioy the Land of promiſe, muſt walke in the way of truth which God there teacheth them.</p>
               <p>Let your Faith ſtill ſtriue againſt each temptation, and in your greateſt weakeneſſe ſeeke to the Lord for ſtrength: Know this my beloued, that the deareſt Children of God may bee ouercome in the battell betweene the Fleſh and the Spirit: and great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences may they fall into,<note place="margin">Iob 3.1. &amp;c. 15 10</note> till God rayſe them vp againe.

But the Cup which the wicked drinke, is more bitter then that which God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to his Children: for hee meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the one by Mercy, and the other by Iuſtice.</p>
               <p>If you ſee you reſt weake, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend your ſelues to Gods mercy,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3626:15"/>
who meaneth not to deſtroy you for your ſinnes, but to correct and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe you, till hee haue pardoned and purged your offences; and ſo burne his rod by which hee hath puniſhed you. <hi>Eſay</hi> 33.1. Remember that as God was the Authour of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity for their ſinnes: ſo was hee for his mercies their Redeemer, to reſtore them to Liberty.</p>
               <p>God in the middeſt of all his threatnings remembreth his, and comforteth them: There is no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſigne of our Heauenly Fathers loue, then when hee correcteth vs for our amendment, preſeruing vs in deſpite of our Enemies; to that end whereunto he hath appointed vs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Glory of Gods Name, and good of his Church. See <hi>Eſay</hi> 44.2. <hi>and Chap.</hi> 30.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.24. What though we be forſaken for a time, yet the Lord caſts vs not off vtterly, as though he our Husband were dead; but in our dreadfulleſt afflictions ſtill followeth vs with his fatherly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours and manifold mercies, to make

               <p>Let your heauy ſinnes bee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually before your eyes, as one that tyeth a thing to his hand for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance: ſo will hee forget them, caſt them behinde his backe, and tread them vnder feet. The Lord comfort and refreſh your ſoule, ſtill treading downe the inſurgent Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that riſe vp againſt you: Let no aduerſity vtterly diſcomfort you, but wiſely conſider that there may bee cauſe of a Womans ſeparation from her Husband, and a ioyfull meeting and comming of them both together againe.</p>
               <p>Wee can neuer be too timely exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed vnder our Croſſe, but wee are to pray, that when our afflictions grow greater, our patience alſo (by experience) may bee ſtronger; and thou Lord, become a Sanctuary vnto vs in the ſoareſt times of our ſaddeſt

               <p>In the dayes of your afflictions and miſeries, remember that God promiſed to comfort his Church in all heauineſſe and deepeſt diſtreſſes: bleſſe God for your puniſhments, for thereby he calleth you from your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; as from the beginning God hath exerciſed his people vnder the Croſſe; ſo ſince Chriſt was offered, hath hee left this exerciſe vnto his Church, vntill the Dead riſe againe, and Chriſt gather his into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the Heauens.</p>
               <p>The Lord giue you patience and conſtancy to abide the paines and plagues, which the Lord inflicteth vpon you, for the humbling of your ſoule, and haſting it to eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. And doubt not, but for your

               <p>Remember the three Children in the fiery Furnace, they would not come out, nor depart thence for any feare, till the Lord bid them: neither came <hi>Noah</hi> out of the Arke, till the Lord called him forth.</p>
               <p>Stay your ſoule vpon God who is now onely to comfort you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how that our abhominable ſinnes bring vpon our ſoules theſe horrible afflictions in our laſt dayes: As you are one of Chriſts members, you may not haſten too much; but learne patiently to abide the Iſſues of Gods promiſe. As the Maieſty of God hath ſtrooke you downe, ſo I doe not feare, but that his powerfull and heauenly hand will againe raiſe you vp: God that by one Angell could deſtroy all the world, aſſureth

               <p>Therefore doeth the Lord make it oftentimes the end of his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: to call vs to Repentance, that wee may ſeeke both for health and helpe at his hands: The Church of Chriſt now is, and muſt be ſtill ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to manifold afflictions, how be-be it, God at length will giue ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iſſue, deliuering them from all troubles.</p>

               <p>It is GODS mercy towards his Children, and his fauour vnto his Friends and followers, to make them pertakers of piety, and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Holineſſe in their places.

               <p>In each trouble and aduerſity wee are to conſider the prouidence of God, and not like raging Beaſts to forget both our owne duty, and contemne GODS appointment o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs. It is Gods pleaſure, to make as though he would leaue vs for a time, yet if wee truſt in him, wee ſhall bee ſure to finde comfort.</p>

ſee that wee are nothing of our ſelues, but that all the ſtrength wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> haue, it is onely in Chriſt. Thirdly, to ſtirre vp our hearts to ſeeke and pray vnto the Lord more earneſtly for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> helpe and ſuccour. Fourthly, to make vs eſteeme the mercy of God more highly, becauſe things eaſily come by, are lightly eſteemed; but things long in getting, coſting much trouble and paines, are moſt ſett by: often therefore doth the Lord deferre his mercy vnto the laſt gaſpe, that ſo it might be the more eſteemed.</p>
               <p>Oh waite wee GODS leaſure, though hee deferre long, and ſeeme to forget vs: wee hope Lord, for life in the middeſt of death, and ſay, though thou kill vs, yet will wee truſt in thee; although thou deferre thine helpe and comfort for many yeares, yet will wee neuer let goe our hold, but ſtill hang on thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with our hands of Faith, ſaying thus; Lord, though thou haſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready whipt mee diuers wayes, yet will I neuer forget to meete thee
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3626:39"/>
with my repentant teares: well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou eſteemeſt nothing when Reformation of heart and life is wanting.</p>
               <p>Iudgements come eftſoones from God for our ſinnes, yet layeth hee no more croſſes vpon vs, then hee in mercy will make vs well able to beare: granting ſuch an iſſue, as wee ſhall gaine more in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then wee ſhall looſe in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Content your ſelfe my Brethren, the Croſſe in GODS due time ſhall bee your aduantage, and leaue a ſure bleſſing behinde it; GOD impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing no puniſhments vpon vs but for our ſinnes, the tryall of our Faith, Patience, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For our Heauenly Father doth afflict vs with light affliction, to make vs runne vnto him and kiſſe his rod: he afflicting vs for our good, the reformation of our liues, and the ſaluation of our ſoules.</p>
               <p>I deny not but the beſt of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may be afflicted with ſicknes and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3626:40"/>
wounds, with troubled Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Gods rod being good both to purge our corrupt and cankered hearts, and for the humbling of them throughly to the exerciſe of faith, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and prayer.</p>
               <p>Hee knowes little that knowes not this, how the poore Members of CHRIST muſt bee afflicted, and liue in ſorrow, ſickneſſe, and griefe of minde; yet granteth the Lord patience to endure all.</p>
               <p>By teares, ſorrowes, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſickneſſe, doth God fyle away the cankered ruſt of our Rebellions, that wee might bee more feruent in Prayer, hunger more after Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and the more eagerly depend of his fatherly goodneſſe, and diuine graces. When wee doe aske one thing, hee giueth vs another that's better for vs, that wee might learne wholy to depend of his goodneſſe all the dayes of our liues. Are you in diſtreſſe, fling your ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bleſſed Armes of the LORDS mercy, ſo will hee vndoubtedly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3626:40"/>
giue you euerlaſting reſt vnto your ſoules: ſuch is the loue of GOD, that hee neuer failes nor forſakes his Children.</p>
               <p>Neuer deſpaire for any troubles, but perſwade your ſoule this, that the God of peace will ſhortly treade downe Sathan vnder your feete: hee is faithfull that haue made vs this promiſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20.<note place="margin">Rom. 16.20.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Affliction being our portion on earth, wee muſt labour to get faith and patience in our ſoules, that ſo wee may hold out vnto the end. As wee are Gods Children, we finde no promiſe in the Word of God to be freed from temptations and trials, pouerty, ſickneſſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Howbeit as wee are Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, wee haue this promiſe, that theſe things ſhall neuer hurt vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord will ſo ſanctifie them vnto vs, as they will ſurely leaue a bleſſing behinde them.</p>
               <p>In time of danger and death, nought in the world ſhould more comfort vs then this, to remember
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3626:41"/>
that wee haue walked before GOD in truth, and with an vpright heart. <hi>Eſay</hi> 28.3. This cheered <hi>Ezechiah</hi> when hee was going the way of all fleſh, that hee had vndertaken much paines to know the LORDS Will.</p>
               <p>The beſt Chriſtian is the moſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous in all heauenly knowledge of God, and our ſaluation by Ieſus Chriſt; the Childe of God is no ſooner in perill, but the Lord put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnder his owne hand to deliuer him from death and danger.</p>
               <p>Forget not God who ſayth, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay</hi> 54.17.8. <hi>For a little time haue I forſaken thee, but with great compaſſion will I gather thee.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Doth not our Sauiour comfort his Diſciples thus, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.18. <hi>I will not leaue you comfortleſſe, but I will come vnto you, euen I, and I am with you to the end of the world.</hi>

                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:3626:41"/>Doubt not but there is comming a time of refreſhing, that will breake out as the riſing of the Sunne, and the bright beames of the Morning after a tempeſtuous Night: which of all things will bee then moſt ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and comfortable.

               <p>The Children of God learne by Aduerſitie to come home to their heauenly Fathers houſe.

               <p>Know this all yee people, that there is more ſollid Ioy in ſuffering rebuke with Chriſt our Maiſter, then in all the pleaſures of ſinne which are but for a ſeaſon.

               <p>It is the Lords mercy to admoniſh before hee correct vs: Hee ſpeakes ſometimes vnto vs by himſelfe, and ſometimes by Chriſt Ieſus: the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Father crying and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vs to heare his voyce, and to receiue Inſtruction, vſing fayre meanes to win vs, rather then threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to fright vs.</p>

               <p>The Lord doth often humble vs, to bring vs home to himſelfe, by his Word and by his Iudgements; yea, his mercies, &amp; the motions of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth our heauenly Father vſe to humble vs. So plagues and iudgments, woes and miſeries doth the Lord cauſe to light vpon vs, mealting e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen away (as it were) our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the boyling Caldron of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Calamities.</p>

               <p>Conſider wee firſt, how wee haue falne by wantonneſſe of life, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly conuerſation, our neglecting Gods word and will, hath brought the cup of Gods indignation vppon vs, to reclaime our feete from folly, and our ſoules from ſinne.</p>
               <p>Not to acknowledge our ſelues to haue deſerued Gods iudgements (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we yet feele them not) is Pride of heart, and a ſtate moſt perillous vntill we be humbled.</p>

               <p>I feare not but that the ſeedes of Faith lyes ſtill in your heart, although the fruite thereof doe not yet plainely appeare: I doe perſwade my heart, that though your eyes waxe dimme, yet the Holy Ghoſt will ſtill giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, the true illumination of your heart, ſoule, and ſeuerall ſences.</p>

dearely hath Chriſt our Redeemer once bought with his blood, both our ſoules and our bodies. I beſeech you hold it a ioy to dye, and to bee out of this ſinfull World, and to bee deliuered from the thraldome of this ſorrowfull life.</p>
               <p>Death is our refuge, the helpe of our ſoules to Heauen, there wee liue eternally, where is no paine, but all pleaſure, no ſorrow but ſolace, no ſighing but ſinging, no feare of death, but aſſurance of euerlaſting Life. It is good for your children to bee afflicted, that they may not ſtray from Gods houſe, but keepe his Word, and to learne and obſerue his Diuine ſtatutes.</p>
               <p>Though we haue beene long chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Lord, but it is that wee ſhould not bee condemned of the Lord.

               <p>I intreate and aduiſe euery one, to be more carefull of their ſoules, then of their bodies, ſtill comforting their hearts in their afflictions, knowing that the ſender thereof is God, and the cauſer thereof, our ſinnes: the longer we be and languiſh in ſinne, the more appeareth Gods loue in our ſicknes, for the which thinke God to bee the ſender, and likewiſe our deliuerer in danger and aduerſity.</p>
               <p>As the Husband-man doth not put the ſickle into the Corne vntill it bee ripe: So doeth not God inflict his grieuous iudgements vpon vs, vntill our ſinnes doe call downe vengeance for the ſame.</p>

               <p>More then that, hee comforted them with the promiſe of the bleſſed Seed, <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> which ſhould reſtore that Saluation vnto mankinde, which they had loſt, by yeelding to the Serpents intiſements.</p>

Beware of temporary faith

which is lame of one hand, onely able to take Chriſt, but not to giue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to Chriſt: This is to offer the ſame offering without the burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; haſt thou Hope againſt Hope, feeleſt thou Hell in thy Conſcience, yet here muſt thou apprehend Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and with <hi>Ionas</hi> (in the Whales belly) call vpon GOD in faith, for faith is the ſubſiſtance of things that are not, much more then of things that in deed are, though not in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.

There is no Chriſtian but he muſt fight before he can tryumph: and be daily calling, yea earneſt by praying and crauing for helpe at Gods hands, remembring that againſt the ignomy of the Croſſe, wee haue to ſet the decree and purpoſe of God, fore-told by the Prophets of Chriſt: How that firſt of all hee ſhould bee crucified here vpon Earth: And then he ſhould appeare from Heauen, the Iudge and Reſtorer of all things: that all Beleeuers might be ſaued, and all vnbeleeuers vtterly periſh.</p>
               <p>Vnderſtand and Know this, that God vſeth to wrappe vp his Church with the wicked, in his ſcourges and plagues which he ſendeth vppon the Earth: and yet notwithſtanding hee prouideth for it conueniently, though he doth moſt commonly grant but a ſhort time of Truce, vnto his Church and children, to be at reſt and quiet in.</p>
               <p>Learne we all to ſet the glory of Chriſt his Reſurrection, againſt the ſhame of the Croſſe and graue; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3626:93"/>
ſeeing it may aſwell bee proued by witneſſe which ſaw it, as by teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Prophets; learne wee all therefore to goe forward in one way, in our vocation, through a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand death.</p>
               <p>Gods prouidence taketh not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the cauſes which God vſeth as meanes, but rather ordereth and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth them to their right vſe, euen then when he openeth an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary iſſue: for then, and not till then came wee to the promiſed and ſure ſaluation, thorow the middeſt of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt and death it ſelfe. Then are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities moſt to be looked for, when the Port and Hauen is neareſt. The godlier you bee, the more ſure ſhall you bee to haue danger vpon danger; but alwaies moſt ſure to haue a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iſſue.</p>
               <p>What, though aduerſity bee the puniſhment of ſinne, yet God in puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing doth not alwaies reſpect ſinne they iudge too raſhly which eyther doe not waite for the Lord, or doe iudge and eſteeme all men according
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:3626:94"/>
to proſperity or aduerſity: let this be ſtill your comfort, the Lord neuer afflicteth his aboue their ſtrength: what though now we behold miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and calamities in a Church; yet is the hope of felicity harboured in our hearts, as if we preſently enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
               <p>Know this, that it is of the Lords mercy that you are eyther helped or healed, <hi>Wiſ.</hi> 18. It is the power of righteouſneſſe that Saints receiue good and euill in like manner, ſinging prayſes for the one aſwell as for the other.</p>
               <p>It is not wiſedomes care to walke with eaſe by crooked paths, and to bring vs into feare and dread, and to torment vs with her diſcipline, vntill ſhe hath tryed our ſoules, and proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs by her iudgements, then will ſhee comfort vs, and ſhew vs her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, and heape vpon vs the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>The Lord now and then ſendeth vs away weeping and mourning: but with ioy and perpetuall gladneſſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:3626:94"/>
will hee bring vs againe vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Remember that <hi>Sion</hi> may bee in Captiuity, and yet ſee her Saluation from God to come with great glory and euerlaſting brightneſſe: ſuffer we therefore as Children the wrath of God patiently, hoping at laſt to tread vpon the necks of our foes, and euer hereafter to reioyce, though now for a time wee mourne. Who would not make haſte to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of GOD liuing vprightly, and be of a good and honeſt conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, as Chriſt once offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe willingly to be taken, that wee might be deliuered.</p>
               <p>Remember in your preſent miſery, how Chriſt being innocent, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of the High-prieſt for that wickedneſſe whereof wee are guilty.</p>
               <p>Chriſt our Sauiour found no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort (any where) that in him wee might bee fulfilled with Celeſtiall ioyes and ſolace euery where, hee was made a curſe, that in him wee
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:3626:95"/>
might bee bleſſed, hee was ſpoyled of his Garments that wee might bee enriched with his Righteouſneſſe: Chriſt healing the manifold miſeries of mankinde, ſheweth that he came to make cleane and wipe away the ſins of the world with his touching hand from Heauen. Feare wee not any accuſers before God, ſeeing that GOD himſelfe abſolueth vs as iuſt, much leſſe neede wee feare damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeing that wee reſt vpon the death and reſurrection, yea the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power and defence of Ieſus Chriſt. Therefore what can there be ſo waighty in this life, or of ſo great force and power, that might now feare vs, although wee might fall from the feare of God wherewith he loueth vs in Chriſt: Surely nothing; it is in it lelfe moſt conſtant and ſure, and alſo in vs conformed by ſtedfaſt faith by Chriſt that loueth vs: we are perfectly iuſt, and through him are wee conquerours ouer miſeries and calamities, although we ſeeme as bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in pieces with the woeful weight
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:3626:95"/>
of woefull dangers, yet as good Chriſtians let vs grow more and more couragious, that the waies and wills of GOD may bee throughly knowne in this world. Remember that the matter of our ſaluation is Chriſt, in whom onely we are endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſpirituall bleſſings vnto ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Oh perſwade your owne ſoules that God hath choſen vs from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in his Sonne, the end of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions being true ioy, and that through the vertue of the Spirit of Chriſt which hee giueth to them which aske it. We ought not to be diſcouraged, but rather to bee incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the perſecutions which the enemies of the Goſpell imagine and practiſe againſt vs, ſeeing that they are certaine witneſſes from GOD himſelfe both of our ſaluation and of the deſtruction of our enemies that hate vs. Perſecution is a ſigne of our ſaluation, becauſe it's a gift of God to ſuffer for Chriſt which gift hee ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth to his owne, as he doth the gift of faith. Grieue not for your great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:3626:96"/>
no not although you ſhould dye to make pefect your oblation with your blood as with a drinke-offering.</p>
               <p>The way to eternall ſaluation is, to follow Chriſt his ſteps by afflictions and perſecutions, vntill wee come to Chriſt himſelfe, who is our marke whereat wee ſhoote, and receiue the reward whereunto God calleth vs to him. Therefore bee not diſquieted through impatiency, ſeeing that God is at hand to giue you remedy againſt all your miſeries, neither bee you carefull for any thing, but with ſure confidence giue God thankes, and craue of him whatſoeuer you haue neede of, that with a quiet conſcience you may wholy and withall your heart ſubmit your ſelfe to him, that you may with <hi>Dauid</hi> beginne with teares and end with thankes.</p>
               <p>The afflictions of the Church may be ſaid to be Chriſts afflictions, by reaſon of that fellowſhip and knitting together, that the body and the head haue one with the other, not that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:3626:96"/>
there is any more neede to haue the Church redeemed, but that Chriſt ſheweth his power in the daily weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his members, and that for the comfort of the whole, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his Childrens hearts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe aſſured comfort is, to enter by afflictions into the Kingdom of Glory.</p>
               <p>Know this that our God being iuſt will puniſh the vniuſt, and will do away the miſeries of his owne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Remember alwayes to ſet the inviſible power of Gods Spirit, which God hath giuen you, agaynſt thoſe ſtormes which may or will come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. I pray remember that the gift of Gods Spirit, is as it were, a certayne liue flame kindled in our hearts, which the fleſh and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell ſeeke to put out: And therefore you and I (on the contrary ſide) muſt labour as much as we can, to foſter and keepe it burning, and not to be pierced thorough, as people whom the Lord will deſtroy.</p>
               <p>Doubt we not, but that our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:3626:97"/>
doth hang vpon Chriſt, who was exhibited in our dayes, and ſuffered farre more grieuous things then wee can: Oh that wee would conſider the profits that come vnto vs by our heauenly Fathers chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=".1"/> Firſt of all ſinne and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious wickedneſſe of our fleſh, is by this meanes tamed: Secondly, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Lords laſhes are true teſtimonies of his fatherly goodwill towards vs inſomuch that they may ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be Baſtards and no Sonnes, which cannot abide to bee chaſtened of God. Thirdly, if all held this right <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to Fathers, to whom (next after God) we owe this life, that they may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully correct their Children: Shall not we be much more ſubiect to that our Father who is the Authour of the ſpirituall and euerlaſting life.</p>
               <p>As many as will become the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followers of Chriſt, muſt (as it were) goe out of the world, bearing their ſeuerall Croſſes: bee not faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted knowing this, that your faith muſt be tryed through manifold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3626:97"/>
whether it bee pure as it ought to be; we may not deſpiſe the Croſſe of Chriſt, which our heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father vſeth as an Inſtrument to poliſh and fine vs: where we are to conſider, that the effect of afflictions is to poliſh and fit vs for the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs in Chriſt, each ſeuerall moment of mans life depending vndoubtedly vpon God. The knowledge of whoſe will doth not onely nothing at all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, vnleſſe the life be anſwerable vnto it, but rather maketh the ſinner farre more grieuous.</p>
               <p>Forget not to bee patient, ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting a moſt happy end of all your troubles, becauſe God is a moſt boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Father, neuer forſaking his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. Conſider I beſeech you by what way we come to eternall glory: is it not by all kinde of afflictions? wherein notwithſtanding faith ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs ſo ſecure, that we are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not ouercome with ſorrow, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo through the beholding of GOD himſelfe with the eyes of Faith are vnſpeakeably ioyfull, becauſe all ſuch
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3626:98"/>
things as they, are but for a time; ſo are they not applyed vnto vs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy vs, but as it were, by fire, purge vs, and to make vs perfect, that at the length we may obtayne ſaluation. Art thou afflicted, Chriſt goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in example and Vertue, as one that ſuffered moſt grieuous torments euen vnto Death, although but in one part only of him, <hi>to wit,</hi> in the fleſh or mans Nature, but yet became conquerour by the Vertue of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity.</p>
               <p>Know this, that GOD keepeth meaſure in his greateſt ſeuerity, bee not offended therefore, neyther ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the vayne ſhaddow of the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the wicked, as though God were not the gouernour of the world, nor thinke that the Wicked are in good caſe, and the godly in Euill; for we may perceiue an by Argument of compariſon of them together in their laſt end: That God who ſpareth not his owne (but nurtureth them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Croſſe) will at length in his time, handle the rebellious and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:3626:98"/>
farre otherwiſe, whom he hath appoynted to vtter deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Although that life be ſayd to bee ſweet, yet is it chayned to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miſeries, and the onely ſalue to cure affliction is to make vſe of the ancient Hiſtory, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3. <hi>Except you amende your liues, you ſhall all likewſe periſh:</hi> Thy ſinnes deſeruing ſcourges, the iuſt hand of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ſtriketh thee, pray that thou mayeſt benefit thereby.

Therefore this one thing remaineth, that we goe forward conſtantly in our vocation to Gods praiſe, and our owne peace.

               <p>It is a miſerable thing to be ſubiect vnto ſinne, which of it owne nature, maketh vs guilty of Death.

               <p>Remember wee all the great <hi>Glory</hi> which wee looke for, a thouſand times ſur-mounting the miſery of our afflictions.

we can enter into Life: And although Chriſt ſeeme ſometimes to neglect his in moſt extreame dangers; yet in time conuenient hee aſſwageth all tempeſts, and bringeth them to the hauen they hope for.

               <p>Our ſufferings are no arguments of Righteouſneſſe, but our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe an ornament vnto our ſufferings: Are we in troubles? lye wee in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles? flye we vnto Chriſt our Lord and Maſter for ayde, who in mercy will heare vs, and deliuer vs by the ſtrength of his mighty power; be our ſtate neuer ſo deſperate, he can helpe it; and we are neuer paſt helpe, ſo long as we deſire to be holpen: The greatneſſe of our perill can be no ſtop to our deliuerance, becauſe the power of our deliuerance is infinite. Tribulations are the way to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen, through ſtormy tempeſts are we brought to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen, being the Hauen that all hunger for.</p>

Thinke it no ſtrange thing for the perfect to ſuffer, neither be you diſcomforted or diſmayed at it, knowing that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions happen by heapes to all Gods Children in this world.

Thoſe ſeede-teares which you ſowe now, are nothing to that Harueſt of ioy which hereafter ſhall be reaped.

It is the meere loue and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute righteouſneſſe of God that we are corrected: it is not for our harme but to our good, either for the tryall of our faith, or for the reformation of our life. So that either man, or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fearing God, walking vprightly in his ſight, (hauing the teſtimony of a good conſcience) cannot want mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of conſolation, hauing ſtill (in the Lord) whereof to be comforted: make we not our hearts heauy and our liues moſt vncomfortable, ſhake we off ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our cauſeleſſe teares, and we ſhal finde matter enough for glorious and vnſpeakeable ioyes.</p>

gone, another followeth; or a ſhip at the Sea, neuer ſafe till wee come into the Hauen and harbour of Heauen, by the death and blood-ſhedding of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt are wee ſanctified and cleanſed from our ſins.</p>
               <p>Our heauenly Father is both paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and pleaſed with vs through the death of Chriſt, who forgiuing and pardoning our ſinnes, imputeth vnto vs his owne righteouſneſſe: ſo that through beleeuing in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt we ſhalbe ſaued, and haue life euerlaſting, and ſhall neuer come into condemnation.</p>
               <p>Through the name of our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, are the ineſtimable benefits of Chriſt wrought in vs, and brought vnto vs; for by faith onely in Chriſt, without any workes of our owne, (either concurring or furthering) we are freely iuſtified.</p>
               <p>No puniſhment diſcharged, but by that perfect man Chriſt Ieſus, who hath vanquiſhed death, and ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp the paires of Hell, yea, ſatisfied the ſeuerity of Gods euerlaſting Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Although death be a ſting to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, piercing them to the heart; yet to the Elect deaths ſting is pulled out, and they are freed from terror by the death of our Sauiour. The death of a faithfull friend yeelds rather cauſe of comfort then of ſorrow, of mirth then of mourning, of reioycing rather then of weeping and lamenting: death is to the godly, like ſleepe, whereby we are refreſhed. Vnfit is it therefore to celebrate the funerals of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full with weeping &amp; wayling, when we doe well know our friends haue liued religiouſly &amp; dyed vertuouſly.

Learne we all to ſhew forth the fruites of our faith, obedience, loue, charity, and hearts purified from ſinne, and ſtill more and more prepare we to Chriſt Ieſus our heauenly Bridegrome, at his comming with more alacrity and ioy triumphant, then either mouth, or man can conceiue or vtter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:3626:120"/>Chriſt by the ſacrifice of his death will take away all our ſinnes, where there is neither ſighing nor ſorrow, but triumphant ioyes in the higheſt Heauens.</p>
               <p>Though the Lord ſend afflictions, yet will hee not forſake vs for euer, what though hee afflict to day, yet will he haue compaſſion vpon thee to morrow, according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
               <p>God doth ſeldome puniſh willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Children of Men, for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions are many, and his fatherly louing kindneſſes are ſo many and ſo multiplied, that wee cannot number them: Maintaine Lord, the cauſe of my ſoule, for thou haſt redeemed my life from the euill imaginations of the wicked, and vengeance of the vile. If you were dead and buried, yet can God reuiue you, and by his great mercy free you from all iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſtill keepe you in the number of the faithfull.</p>
               <p>The Almighty ſo exerciſe your contrite heart, as both it ſole ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:3626:120"/>
may be laudably imployed in the Lords ſeruice.</p>
               <p>Sickneſſe to the ſeruants of God doth bring infinite ioy, and much goodneſſe; it's a purgation and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of our ſins, the mother of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude &amp; ſpirituall ſtrength againſt our frailty, and ſure defence againſt all worldly troubles. A purchaſing of grace and pardon, a medicine of life, and a comfortable guide to reduce vs from hell, and bring vs all to the Celeſtiall Paradiſe. I beſeech you to remember what troubles and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are, a purchaſing of grace and pardon, a merry time of life, and a continuall remembrance of Chriſts owne bleſſed life, death and paſſion. We are all duely to conſider, how that our humane bodies are as darke and filthy priſons of our ſoules, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing as in exile, baniſhment, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
               <p>The Almighty deliuer you from hell, ſinne and eternall death for euer. The Lord comfort you, and are you from ſin, and ſtrengthen your weake

heart againſt Sathan, who ſtill ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth againſt you to ſeduce you; but remember you Gods Angels, that are ready preſt for to aide you, his grace for to guide you, and his fauour for to feede you. Arme Lord thy Seruants heart with perpetuall peace and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, giue thy weake Creature grace moſt ioyfully to beare the burden of the Croſſe: As Heauen is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably greater then the Earth, ſo the Mercy of our heauenly Father reſts incomparably greater then the ſeas of our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Lord free you from bitter ſorrows all ſinnes and grieuances whatſoeuer they bee. The Almighty of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy renue your Repentance, and vnbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den you of the weight of all your great bonds, moſt grieuous ſins, lay we faſt hold on Chriſt his mercy, death and paſſion. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16. The life of each one of vs being but a vitall Laborinth, and a confuſed Chaos, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foording vs nought but fraude, folly, and fleſhly ſenſuality and troubles to try vs, and ſundry aduerſities to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet

All muſt taſte of miſeries, diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſorrows, before our ſoules by death be deliuered from their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall burden. Although it bee an happy thing to die in Ieſus Chriſt, yet ſuch reſts the fooliſhneſſe of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt fleſh, that wee are loath to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue from bad to better, from Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Saints and heauenly Aſſociats, we loſe nothing in our changing our bad place for a better.</p>
               <p>But one thing, we that are Gods Children, muſt ſtill bee moſt carefull of (to dread furious foes) dangers.</p>
               <p>Comfort wee our hearts in our deepeſt diſtreſſes, acknowledging God to be more able to defend vs, then all foes to confound vs; not any Gods Children but burdned with calamities, <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> King of <hi>Babell</hi> was turned out a grazing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yeares.</p>
               <p>Gods Children are more afflicted then others, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.16. The daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Abraham</hi> was for 18 yeares.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:3626:122"/>
bound of Sathan, likewiſe the man whom our Sauiour cured, had beene diſeaſed 38. yeares. Comfort your heart in your afflictions, knowing God to bee the ſender of afflictions by reaſon of our ſins. It's the Lord who killeth and maketh aliue, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the graue, and raiſing vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.6.</p>
               <p>If Chriſt had not beene the Sonne of God, Sathan would neuer haue ſo much aſſaulted him and his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, for his ſanctifying and ſauing of innumerable Saints and Soules.</p>
               <p>Labour wee all for the Word and Goſpell of Trueth, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our temptations are, let vs all and euery one, weepe for our owne ſinnes, and not once ſtubbornely defend the perpitrating of the leaſt of any vile and corrupt ſinnes and offences.</p>
               <p>Almighty God ſo moderate your greateſt croſſes and grieuances, as your ſoule may euer ſing with Saints.</p>
               <p>Our moſt gracious father deferreth his helpe, not that hee will not

helpe vs, but to exerciſe our Fayth, and ſtirre vp in vs, the calling vppon his name, and ſtill being acquainted with Gods mercies, reioyce Night and day in his Euerlaſting fauours: would you haue peace, none but Chriſt can giue it you, and he will giue to none but to the penient, to none but the Faithfull.</p>
               <p>Set wee our Lord Ieſus Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene GOD and our ſinnes; let it reſt our deſire to ſpend our ſelues in ſighes and teares of true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and then rayſe vp our humble Soules to a liuely Confidence, in our onely Sauiour, and All-ſufficient Redeemer; by whoſe Righteouſnes we are diſcharged of tranſgreſſions; beſides Chriſt our Redeemer, there is no other Sauiour. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. Dearely beloued brethren, wee are all by vicinity and cohabitation, but Chriſts by Faith, and hope our Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation is, by Chriſt, in Heauen: He is the guide of our loues in the true loue and feare of Almighty GOD, in whoſe loue, if our heartes bee
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:3626:123"/>
guided, feare we not for the waiting and laſt comming of Chriſt: wee are now (each one of vs) to learne to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and withdraw our ſelues from ſtill walking inordinately, ſeeke wee all to become enſamples to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſanctified liues, and not of ſloath and idleneſſe: aske your ſoules my Chriſtian brethren, with what price, and from what miſery, you are now Redeemed and ranſomed: not others, but thou and I alſo, muſt warn our ſelues from each loath-ſome and haynous ſinne, and carefully all our liues hereafter, weane our ſoules and ſenſes, both from each former ſinne and tranſgreſſion, and future ſenſe alike.</p>
               <p>So ſeperate thy ſelfe from ſin, that of a ſinner thou mayeſt become a a Saint, and a true ſeruant of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing GOD.</p>
               <p>Admit a King take to Wife a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a low eſtate and birth, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her Queene of all his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will not hee both looke and commaund of her, to caſt off her

olde attire, and to leaue her former (both company and behauiour) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing her ſelfe to a moſt Court-like carriage: Now tell me, hath not the King both of Heauen and Earth <hi>(Ieſus Chriſt)</hi> married our ſoules vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſſe:</hi> Many haue in their hope, health, and happineſſe, and in a night all quite vaniſhed before morning: wee poore miſerable and diſpiſed wretches, muſt all conſider this, that our goodneſſe reacheth not GOD, but his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes reach and extend vnto vs, in that our hearts are rayſed to haue ſtill our confidence and onely truſt in our Redemer and All-ſufficient Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt Ieſus, without whom we haue neyther ſafety, nor ſure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, nor confidence: GOD muſt haue, keepe, and ſtill retayne in his owne cuſtody Gouernment and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue, in keeping each thing in its due order and nature, both ſmall and great.</p>
               <p>Our goodneſſe reacheth not vnto God, but his louing kindneſſe to vs,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:3626:124"/>
and Fatherly compaſſions, doe farre exceed the drops of water in the Sea, or the minutes of time.</p>
               <p>Be ſtill doing good in your liues, that you may haue comfort in your very end, and poynt of Death, and a glorious Crowne of Eternall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: peace and comfort bee this day and euer with vs, who are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and choſen ones of GOD. Lord bee mercifull vnto vs, in our Afflictions, and let it not bee thine holy will to deſtroy vs: But looke vpon vs that ſtill cry vnto thee in our manifold afflictions.</p>
               <p>Let your aſſurance of Heauenly things, make you the more willing to part with Earthly traſh: VVhy ſhould wee feare or doubt in our ſelues, when Almighty God ſendeth for vs, to take poſſeſſion of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Paſſe we chearefully through the blacke gates of Death, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he looke grim, on vs, at the firſt, yet will helpe vs paſſe cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully through the blacke Gates, vnto our glory. God had not loued you,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:3626:124"/>
if he had not made you poore: To ſome it is aduantage to looſe, and to haue rather eyes full of teares, then purſes full of gold.</p>
               <p>A Chriſtian may not thinke it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to endure the thought of death with patience, but when it is obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon him, by neceſſity, then muſt he call it into his minde with ioy, ſtill wayting vntill it come. It can bee none but a Diuine power that can vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the minde of man or woman, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the rage of many afflictions: wee muſt not account the beſt things of this life, any other things, then chaynes and burdens, to as many as haue them, ſtill acknowledging that the greateſt on earth, are but Tennants at will, to day liuing, by and by dead: Thinke we oft on Chriſt Ieſus, which ſuffered for vs all, hee payed all, hee did it for vs in loue: Where ſhall we begin to admire and wonder but at Chriſt Ieſus, our Diuine and Eternall Peace-maker, the Sauiour of men, the Annoynted of GOD, the Mediator betweene GOD and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:3626:125"/>
Man, in whom there is nothing that doth not exceed, not onely the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, but the wonder of Angels, who ſaw thee in thy Humiliation, with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence adore thee in thy Glory, with perpetuall prayſes and reioycing. Soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner would be no Summer, if Winter did not lead it in and follow it.</p>
               <p>We may not eyther hope or ſtriue to eſcape all Croſſes, ſome we may, that we cannot flye from; and what we cannot allay and mittigate in croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Vniuerſally, let this be thy rule, make thy ſelfe none, eſcape ſome, beare the reſt, ſweeten all. We muſt conſider whence afflictions come, &amp; by whoſe prouidence they are guided and tempered with our Heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers loue.</p>
               <p>All our miſeries are ſtinted, good things challenging more then bare contentment: Our croſſes come com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly for our good: we muſt all of vs reſolue to fight ſtoutly for our Heauen, that after all ſighes and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes we may reſolue to perfect in ſuffering till we ouer-come, and be
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:3626:125"/>
Crowned in Glory, and a few groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings vpon earth end our afflictions, be they neuer ſo many, tedious or troubleſome, chooſe rather to mourne for a while, then for euer.</p>
               <p>Chriſt our Sauiour taſting a bitter portion, teacheth vs to ſmart ere wee raigne. It is no matter how vile you ſeeme now, bee content to be called to the Cup, (now of tryall) pledge we our Redeemer in drinking Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and Gall, for ſo ſhall wee drinke new Wine with him in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory, honour, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happineſſe.</p>
               <p>Lord ſeaſon your wills and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie each one of all our hearts, ſo as wee may ſpend our daies and ſtrength to glorifie our Redeemer.</p>
               <p>Acquaint your ſelfe with GOD now in your life time, intreate him with teares to become the Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of your ſoules in your death, and dayes of your carefulleſt calamities: So walke in true holineſſe as you ſtil may reſt in euerlaſting felicity.</p>
               <p>If you would not haue GOD
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:3626:126"/>
to deſpiſe your ſoules vpon your death-bed, then muſt you in the dayes of your health, fit and fyle your ſoule with diuine grace. Inure your ſelfe to be furniſhed with the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Grace, ſo neede you not feare the malice of any mortall man, not raging Creature. Set Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus betweene God and your ſinnes, and God cannot ſee our debt: Let Sinne, Sathan, Hell and Death, with the world and her worſt Enemies doe what they can. Chriſt hauing riſen and become our Surety, his blood reſts for ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Remember wee all how wee haue God the Father for our Gouernour, and his Word for our Guide: who would liue that knoweth his Maſter died, and in his life ſuffered ſo many bitterſtormes and temptations.</p>
               <p>Temptations are the common ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies of the beſt Seruants of GOD. You may read how Sathan came to Chriſt, and tempted him in a high manner ſaying, if thou be Chriſt, if thou be the Son of God, doe this and this:
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:3626:126"/>
euen when hee was at the weakeſt, hauing faſted ſo long; to haue ſtones made Bread, and if hee would haue any, he muſt make it himſelfe too; a hard cruſt, bread out of ſtones. And if he durſt appeare to him who was the Sonne of God, how may hee venture vpon vs, and tempt vs; and cauſe vs to bee diſcouraged and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire of our ſoules: therefore my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, haue no conceit, or diſpaire of hope in God, though the Diuell tempt vs, and we endure many other croſſes in this world which man is ſubiect vnto: Though yee were in the famine of <hi>Samaria,</hi> where the people did eate their Pigeons dung. Or as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> relates of the miſeries of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> when it was beſieged, how that the Mothers were forced to eate their owne children, to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their ſtomacks: though all theſe, and many more ſhould happen vnto vs, yet let vs truſt in GOD with a ſtrong faith and hope, for he is able to deliuer vs out of all our afflictions. What a comfort it is when we haue
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:3626:127"/>
Chriſt and his Diſciples to take our parts, and but to ſuffer as they haue done: If the enuy of the world, or malice of the Diuell bee ſuch, that I am depriued of my Lands or Liuings, then haue I <hi>Iob</hi> for an example; If I bee exiled or baniſhed from my Countrey, then haue I <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt for my comfort: If I be put in Priſon, then haue I <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and if I be put in the inward Priſon and in the Stocks, then <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas,</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> for my Companions. If I am beheaded, then haue I <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt for my patterne, or if I be ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death, then haue I the happy Martyr St. <hi>Stephen;</hi> or if I haue been accuſed wrongfully, then haue I our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus for my comfort It is he that hath wrought that great worke of our Redemption. The faithfull and the thankefull ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually receiue Gods word and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, they ſhall haue in abundance, and not abundance onely, but ſhall haue it with ſweetnes, for abundance without ſweetneſſe is a clogging or
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:3626:127"/>
cloying of the ſtomacke, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe without abundance, is a beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of an appetite or ſtomacke; but they ſhall haue ſhowred downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in a plentifull manner, that nothing may be wanting to them that are patient and of long ſuffering; the flood-gates of the Lord ſhal be open vnto them that truely beleeue; they be thoſe which ſhall haue grace, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and plenty of all earthly treaſures. It is Gods mercy in giuing vs this day to heare his diuine Precepts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, it is his mercy that he ſpareth vs, which might for our ſinnes bee iuſtly puniſhed, and bee made an example to all people, like <hi>Herod;</hi> in that wee haue not giuen thee that due praiſe and honour which thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of vs thy Creatures. VVe muſt exhort one another, for it is Gods command to examine euery one him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, whether hee hath faith or no; And likewiſe euery Maiſter his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant in his family, to know whether they truſt in the Lord, and ſerue him as <hi>Abraham</hi> did: Chuſe who will
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:3626:128"/>
ſerue the Lord, for I and my houſe ſhall ſerue the Lord; for we ſhall one day be examined how wee haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed our time, and how wee haue made vſe of our Talent; for ignorance then muſt be no excuſe to any man.</p>
               <p>Let no man therefore which deſires Gods loue be negligent in hearing of the Word vpon the Sabbath day, for there is in it both a hardneſſe of the heart, and alſo a neglect of the duty; which is a very dangerous act, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect Gods precepts, and to fall as it were from the liuing God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let reaſon follow our faith, not faith our reaſon; earneſtly crauing of God that he would bee pleaſed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen our hearts at the hearing of his holy Commandements, as he did his Seruant <hi>Lydia, Paul, Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen.</hi> None are exempted from comming to heare Gods Word, for the Lord ſayth, behold, I will powre out my Spirit vpon you, and your ſonnes and your daughters; I will put my feare into their hearts, and I will write my Law in their mindes, and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:3626:128"/>
they ſhall neuer depart from me who am the liuing God.</p>
               <p>Our Soules muſt be like the Sunne, not like <hi>Ioſhuahs</hi> Sunne, to ſtand ſtill; nor like <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> Sun, to goe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but we muſt be like <hi>Dauids</hi> Sun, which comes out and appeares like a Bridegrome, or like a Gyant ready to run his courſe; and ſtriue we by all meanes to ſtrengthen and goe forwards in Faith and good workes, for we haue no deſert of our owne to ſaue our ſoules at the laſt day, but muſt ſay and confeſſe as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> did, <hi>O Lord, what is my merit but thy mercy, thy mercy but my merit in</hi> CHRIST IESVS.</p>
